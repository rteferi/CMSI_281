Homework01 Evaluation
======================

Adequate job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Your code looks pretty good, but you need to be consistent with
your indenting and you have no header block in the files.  Your
test coverage is pretty minimal, and you don't seem to have a
true test for the "getMax()" method, of which there should be
five.

Still, works as advertised....

you got 7 out of 10 which is 70% which is a C-minus
