Homework03 Evaluation
======================

Pretty good work on this assignment!
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

The testing of BubbleSortApp is pretty anemic.  You only have
one test case which is not nearly enough.  You'd want to test
both positive and negative numbers, zeros, pre-sorted in order,
pre-sorted in reverse order and so on.  You should also display
what the expected output is, so that the user can see if things
are working properly.

Your Simon game doesn't actually work.  I ran it and it told me
the "first disk" is "B" but when I entered "B" the game says
"game over.  Play again!".  So, it's not comparing correctly,
and the idea was to *ask* the user if they *want* to play again
and then re-start if they say "yes".

The coding style in "ArrayBub.java" needs improvement.  Make
indenting consistent among ALL OF YOUR FILES.  If you're using
two spaces per indent, make them all that way.  Be sure to
indent ALL lines in a block or method definition.

Total credit is 13 for Sorter and either Simon or Huffman
 extra credit is 7 points for other of Simon or Huffman
-------------------------
 Grand total is 20 points for all three

you got 10.5 out of 13 which is 80.77% which is a B-minus
