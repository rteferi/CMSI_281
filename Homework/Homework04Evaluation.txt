Homework04 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment...
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Your code looks great and thanks for doing headers!

These were from Adam's repo.

I had to fix the HashTable.java file for a missing "{".  No
biggie, as I've said before, one error I'll fix for free.

HashTableApp.java doesn't compile, either.  It needs to handle
the IOException which might be thrown when doing console input.
I'm not going to fix that one, because there are different ways
to handle it and I don't know which method you prefer.  You'd
need to add a try/catch block somewhere.....  I'm giving you
half credit on it, though, since you did write code...

I don't see a digit folding hasher program in this directory
at all....  sorry about that!

Total credit is 30 points
-------------------------

you got 20.5 out of 30 which is 68.33% which is an D-plus
I'll round up significantly so you can get a solid "C".
   adding 3 full points makes it a 75.81%.
